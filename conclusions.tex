\section{Conclusions}
We present a benchmark for validating throughput model of x86-64 basic blocks.
We describe the techniques with which we collected
and profiled 300,000 basic blocks from real-world applications.
Our benchmark can be used to systematically evaluate and tune performance models
of x86-64 basic blocks.
We evaluated four throughput prediction models, including two recently
published research models.
Our evaluation shows that even the best models we evaluated can differ from
the ground truth by more than 20\%, and sometimes more, 
for certain classes of basic blocks;
in particular, we show that existing throughput predictors have difficulty 
modelling memory dependency and vectorized basic blocks reliably.
